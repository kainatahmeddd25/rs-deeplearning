Introduction
This repository contains all the basic details of project "Research Article Recommender 
System using Deep Learning". 


This system produces a list of articles according to the 

It is a Python Based Recommendation engine that 
will cater different algorithms in order to deal with large amount of data. 

This Recommnedation System may have many challenges to their developement like 
processing a complex data ,lack of right data as user will be providing with endless input data which might also increase the storage of disk unnecessarily. 

Recommendation system produces a list of artciles according to the user's preferences 
on basis of citaton-analysis. 
The system will work on collabrative filtering algorithms in order to to produce desired result and assist in decision making. 
Model preparation will be done on basis of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) that will be able to derive features in depth. 


Once the model will be prepared its accuracy will be checked with testing data, this will ensure that model prepared has minimum error 

Novelty of Recommndation system is one of the qualities that increases the effectivesness and add value to the system. 


Process/key tasks: 
1) Data Preparation: 
It includes data/web scrapping where data will be imported from websites and then the the data will be stored in file it can be saved in some files 
second comes data cleaning, filtering the data and removing the duplicates records from the dataset. 

 ,,
Outcome: 
The System will recommendend articles on basis of user's preferences, it will help the user to maintain  his/her profile and publications 

Requirements

Python 3.9. 0
 conda with Python versions 3.6 and 3.7.
